Given three integers a, b, and c, find the minimum non-negative integer x such that:

((a | x) & (b | x)) = c, where as | denotes the Bitwise OR and & denotes the Bitwise AND.

Note: If no such x exists, return -1.

Examples

Input bigvee a = 14 . b = 5 c = 6

Output: 2

Explaination: The value of x = 2 the expression ((alx) & (b|x)) = c is satisfied.

Input: a = 2 b = 3 c = 9

Output: -1

Explaination: no value of x such that ((alx) & (b|x)) = c is satisfied.

Constrains: 1 <= a <= 10 ^ 8
1 <= b <= 10 ^ 8
1 <= c <= 10 ^ 8
